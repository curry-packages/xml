# xml - Libraries for XML processing

This package contains libraries for processing XML data,
like reading and writing XML files, converting, or querying XML documents.

Currently, it contains the following libraries:

* `XML`: This module defines a datatype for representing XML data and
  operations for reading and writing XML data, e.g., which is stored in files.
* `XmlConv`: This module provides type-based combinators to construct XML
  converters.
* `XCuery`: This module defines combinators to search in XML documents.
  It is a literate Curry program which contains the paper
  [Declarative Processing of Semistructured Web Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICLP.2011.198)
  which appeared in the
  Technical Communications of the 27th International Conference on
  Logic Programming (ICLP 2011),
  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), Vol. 11,
  pp. 198-208, 2011
